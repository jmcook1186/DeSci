#DeSci
proof of concept minimum viabe product for decentralised science infrastructure using Ethereum and NFTS
Initial aim is to develop nearly-free, transparent, decentralised science article publishing system that tracks article/user metrics


# TODOs

1. write funcs for tracking NFT metrics (requires a way to "borrow" NFT to cite it and to share credit between multiple authors)
2. front end should take PDF of paper and automatically cite other papers in reference list
3. write proper tetss that include security testing
4. NFT URI should link to IPFS not https address
5. deploy to Kovan and check on openSea to ensure papers are rendered correctly
