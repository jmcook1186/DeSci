#DeSci
proof of concept minimum viabe product for decentralised science infrastructure using Ethereum and NFTS
Initial aim is to develop nearly-free, transparent, decentralised science article publishing system that tracks article/user metrics

Current functionality:
	user writes article and mints it as NFT
	NFT visible on OpenSea with image and properties
	NFT tracks citation metrics
	full paper downloadable to anyone by visiting the external_url in NFT metadata

# TODOs

1. find way to share ownership between multiple accounts
2. build front end
3. proper tests
4. NFT URI should link to IPFS not https
5. add payment funcs so that publishing fees accumulate and then deposit to lending pool


# Status
code is under development and is not covered by any warranty neither explicit nor implied. This code has not been audited.
